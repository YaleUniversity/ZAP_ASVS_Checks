# ZAP_ASVS_Checks
The ZAP_ASVS_Checks (ZAC) project aims to extend the [ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/) vulnerability scanner with scripts to implement OWASP [ASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) L1 controls checking.

This project is inspired by the [OWASP ASVS 4.0 testing guide](https://github.com/BlazingWind/OWASP-ASVS-4.0-testing-guide) project by BlazingWind, which provides a number of ZAP scripts and a BASH script for ASVS L1 checks.  For additional information about the BlazingWind project, please see the blog post, [Automate checking ASVS controls using ZAP scripts](https://www.zaproxy.org/blog/2021-02-10-automate-checking-asvs-controls-using-zap-scripts/).

In-depth instructions and demonstration on how to use our scripts can be [found on Vimeo.](https://vimeo.com/702190939)
